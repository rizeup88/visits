# View My Trips (Places You've Been)

#### This page is designed to show a deeper look at the places I've visited in recent months. Updated as of September 11, 2019

#### By Chase J. Smith

## Description

With this program, you can view many of the locations added by me in a listed format. Each location is available to view in greater detail, including viewing the location, the date I visited, the number of days I was visiting, and my favorite sight I saw while I was there. Using a special tab, these details are listed in order, but when you click on the link once again, they will disappear until clicked on again.

## Specifications

When the page opens up, you're going to be presented immediately with a list of locations of specific locations I have visited.

Each location initially shows both the name of the spot I've visited, and an image of a sight I've visited in that location.

Using a special tab shown below the image, you can open a list of information detailing my trip to that location including...

* City, State

* Date of Visit

* Number of Days Visited

* Favorite Sight Seen While There

Once you've reviewed the list of details of each trip, you can close the list up from the same tab used to open the list.
